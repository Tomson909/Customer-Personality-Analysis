# Pitch
## Story
My name is Tom Ruge and I am from a imaginary consulting company ***TickleTech Consulting: Where Solutions Are Just a Touch Away!*** and presenting my first pitch ever. I am applying for a competitive pitch in this company. This company runs both local und online businesses and it is their goal to provide more specific offers to the customers. Therefore it is necessary to segment different groups of customers. Secondary goals and questions are:
- Do the promotions have an impact on the amount spend? -> What was the most lucrative Campaign?
- Is the spending behavior different between store purchases and web purchases?
- What products are the most lucrative? 
## What should it contain?
The Pitch is supposed to be **3 min** long. So I will plan 45 seconds for ech slide, which makes 4 content slides plus extra slides. Enumeration of each slide for my presentation:
1. **Introduction:** Explain the business and task in simple terms.
2. **Problem**: What wants the company to be solved. Why is it necessary to do want I want to do?
3. **Solution:** Explain my approach of the problem.
4. **Outcomes:** What could be the outcome? Maybe already some numbers of my EDA. The goal is to hook the customer.
